# Rails as an API Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Please note:

-   Many of the readings will mention the "view" layer. We won't be covering the
    view layer in this program.
-   We'll use our [Rails API Template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template)
    repository as the basis for our rails applications.
    This template excludes the "view" layer.

## Define Model Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the model layer are in
Rails.

```md
The model stores and validates data that comes in from browser to the database.
```

## Define Controller Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the controller layer are
in Rails.

```md
The controller parses user requests and data submissions.

## Define Router Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the router does in Rails.

```md
The router sends URLs to a controller's action. Controller actions are HTTP verbs.
```

## The Request-Response Cycle in Rails

Starting with a client making a GET request to a particular URL, describe how
the parts of Rails interact to produce and send a response.

```md
1. Browser makes GET request, for example a "show"
2. Request gets sent to the router
3. The router decides where to send the request to the controller based on the URL
4. The controller parses the request and the data
5. The controller sends the parsed requested to the Model
6. The model will send back the requested info based on the request to the controller
7. The controller serves up the response to the web server
8. Web server presents the data to the users
```
